Arepository to "Temporal Link Prediction in Co-Authorship Networks Using Graph Embedding Dynamics" paper.

Temporal_LP predicts 2019 locations
C_Similarity Computes similarity between predicted locations in Temporal_LP
Data files cannot be loaded, Data_ folder contains predicted 2019 locations, so there is no need to run Temporal_LP and in C_Similarity you can skip step 1-6
(first you need to read data files in C_Similarity and then compute similarities
